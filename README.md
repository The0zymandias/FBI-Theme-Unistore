# FBI-Theme-Unistore
A collection of themes for the FBI app, collected and cataloged by me and created by many others. All credit for the themes go to the original authors.

Unistore nstallation steps:

1. Make sure you have Universal-Updater on your 3DS
2. Open Universal-Updater and then select the gear icon on the bottom left
3. Select 'Select Unistore'
4. At the bottom center, tap on the plus icon
5. Select the QR icon in the bottom left and then scan this QR code.
6. You can now swap between the default homebrew store (Universal-DB) and this FBI themes store by going to 'Select Unistore'.
